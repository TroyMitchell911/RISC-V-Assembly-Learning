# Whatâ€˜s ISA

ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) is the abbreviation of instruction set architecture. It is an abstract description of the computer architecture that defines the set of instructions that the computer processor can execute, as well as the format, operation, and register functions of these instructions. Realizes the abstraction of computer hardware and software.

# ISA naming convention

ISA naming convention: RV{###}{abc...xyz}

RV: Prefix used to identify RISC-V architecture, which is abbreviation of RISC-V.

###: Character width used to identify the CPU. For example: 32,64,128. 

abc...xyz:  Instruction set module collection used to identify what's the CPU supports. For example: 'I' is the basic integer instruction set; 'E' is a subset of 'I', used in small embedded scenarios. 'M' is the multiplication instruction set...
