### `la` Instruction

The `la` (Load Address) instruction is a pseudo-instruction commonly used in RISC-V assembly language to load the address of a label or a memory location into a register. It is often used to simplify the process of obtaining the address of data or code in a program.

However, it's essential to note that `la` is not a native RISC-V instruction but is implemented using a combination of `auipc` and `addi` instructions.

#### Execution of `la`

The `la` instruction is typically implemented using the `auipc` (Add Upper Immediate to PC) instruction followed by the `addi` (Add Immediate) instruction. Here's how it works:

1. The `auipc` instruction is used to add an immediate value, shifted left by 12 bits, to the address of the current instruction, effectively obtaining the upper 20 bits of the desired address.
2. The `addi` instruction is then used to add the remaining lower 12 bits of the address to the result obtained from the `auipc` instruction, yielding the complete address.
3. The final address is stored in the destination register specified in the `la` instruction.

```assembly
.text
.global _start

_start:
    auipc x5, %pcrel_hi(my_label)    # Load upper immediate: Load the upper 20 bits of the address of 'my_label' into x5
    addi x5, x5, %pcrel_lo(my_label) # Add immediate: Add the lower 12 bits of the address of 'my_label' to x5

    # Now the address of 'my_label' is in register x5

    # Your code here

my_label:
    nop   # Just a placeholder instruction
```

`%pcrel_hi` and `%pcrel_lo` are compiler directives used in RISC-V assembly language to calculate the high and low parts of an address relative to the program counter (PC).

- `%pcrel_hi` calculates the high 20 bits of the address relative to the PC.
- `%pcrel_lo` calculates the low 12 bits of the address relative to the PC.

#### Example

```assembly
la x5, my_label
// Loads the address of the label 'my_label' into register x5.
```
