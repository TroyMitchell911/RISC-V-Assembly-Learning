### `lui` Instruction

The `lui` (Load Upper Immediate) instruction in RISC-V assembly language loads a 20-bit immediate value into the upper 20 bits of a register, setting the lower 12 bits to zero. It follows the syntax:

```
lui rd, imm
```

- `rd`: Destination register where the result will be stored.
- `imm`: Immediate value, the 20-bit constant to be loaded into the upper bits of `rd`.

#### Usage Note

When using `lui` to load an immediate value greater than 20 bits, such as `0x12345fff`, the lower 12 bits are sign-extended. This means that if the immediate value's 20th bit is 1 (indicating a negative number), the lower 12 bits will be set to 1s to maintain the correct signed representation. 

For example, if loading `0x12345fff`:

- `lui` loads `0x12346` into the upper bits of the register.
- The lower 12 bits are sign-extended to `0xfffff`, maintaining the negative value.

Therefore, when loading immediate values that require more than 20 bits, it's necessary to consider the sign extension behavior and adjust the immediate value accordingly.

#### Example

```assembly
lui x5, 0x12346
// Load the immediate value 0x12346 into the most significant 20 bits of register x5.

addi x5, x5, -1
// Add the immediate value -1 to the value in register x5, setting the lower bits to 0xfff.

```
