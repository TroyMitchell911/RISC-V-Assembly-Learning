### `auipc` Instruction

The `auipc` (Add Upper Immediate to PC) instruction in RISC-V assembly language is used to add an immediate value shifted left by 12 bits to the address of the current instruction, and store the result in a destination register. It follows the syntax:

```
auipc rd, imm
```

- `rd`: Destination register where the result will be stored.
- `imm`: Immediate value, a 20-bit constant to be shifted left by 12 bits and added to the current PC.

#### Usage

The `auipc` instruction is primarily used for generating PC-relative addresses for accessing data or code in the vicinity of the current instruction.

#### Example

```assembly
auipc x5, 0x12345
// Add the immediate value 0x12345 shifted left by 12 bits to the address of the current instruction,
// and store the result in register x5.
```
